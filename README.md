# JS Password Generator 

The goal behind this project was to program a password generator inside of a web broswer using Javascript. The project acceptance criteria instructed to allow the user to set password parameters (password length, inclusion of capital or lowercase letters, numbers and symbols) through javascript prompts. I opted instead to code a GUI that sets password generators parameters.

Arrays of possible characters to be included in the generated password are created using character codes. ASCII table reference provided by http://www.asciitable.com/
